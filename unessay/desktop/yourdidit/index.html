        <p>
            You did it!<br>
            Your desktop is clean!<br>
            You're <em>so</em> brave!<br>
            This journey you've gone on is so...<br>
            It's so interesting!<br>
            I don't know if you knew this,<br>
            but I'm actually a huge computer cleaning ally.<br>
            Like, I watch <em>Roople's Data Race</em> every week.<br>
            If anything, I'm the <em>most</em> supportive person around.<br>
            Like- hello world! Hahaha...<br>
            Plus my cousin is a programmer- or wait...<br>
            Maybe they were a... data... engineer...?<br>
            Whatever, it's all computer stuff.<br>
            Just like you've been doing!<br>
            So if ever you wanna talk about...<br>
            <br>
            tech stuff.<br>
            You can talk to me!<br>
